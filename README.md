# stackoverflowception
A collection of all the exception handlers that point you to the fitting Stack Overflow tag in as much languages as possible!

Feel free to fork, add any language and pull request!

## What are these handlers for anyway?

As many of you developers know, Stack Overflow is the source of (most) answers to anything related to programming.
So someone [smart](https://twitter.com/DivineOmega/status/695744177557106688) came up with the idea of writing an exception handler that links you to the Stack Overflow search
with the language tag and the exception message.

This repository is a fun project to see how many exception handlers for Stack Overflow we can collect together and help
others to get rid of their problems!
